# RT-StreamSale-Dash
Overview:
Managing and monitoring sales at traditional stores faces many challenges due to manual recording methods and the inability to aggregate real-time revenue data. Tracking daily, monthly, and yearly revenue, along with analyzing sales trends and inventory needs, requires a more automated and efficient solution.

Project Objective:
The Real-time StreamSale Dash project uses Apache Kafka and Apache Spark technologies to stream sales data directly and analyze it in real-time. This system will help automatically aggregate revenue data, analyze sales trends, identify best-selling products, and forecast inventory needs. The results will be visualized through Superset with an easy-to-use dashboard, helping store managers make timely and effective business decisions.

Process:
Collection: The dataset from Kaggle will be processed and continuously sent to Kafka, simulating the sales transaction generation process.
Processing: The data will be processed and analyzed in Apache Spark to prepare for dashboard creation.
Visualization: The analysis results will be visualized using Superset, making the sales and inventory analysis results easy to read.
